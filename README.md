[<img src="./docs/logo.png" style="margin:7px" align="right" width="33%" alt="Sly 1 Decompilation Logo by Cooper941">][docs-url]

This is a work-in-progress decompilation of [*Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sly_Cooper_and_the_Thievius_Raccoonus) for the PlayStation 2. It builds the NTSC-U version of the game, `SCUS_971.98` (SHA1: `57dc305d`).

Our goal is to fully decompile the game engine to matching source code. This repo does **not** contain any assets or original code from the game's files; you need your own copy of the game to build and run it.

Documentation of the code is hosted at [theonlyzac.github.io/sly1](https://theonlyzac.github.io/sly1). For more info on the game's internal systems and mechanics, check out the [SlyMods Wiki][wiki-url].

New contributors are welcome to make a pull request! If you would like to help but aren't sure where to start, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [join our Discord server][discord-url] if you have any questions.

## ⚡ Quickstart

You can quickly setup the project on Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu (or WSL) and on macOS using the quickstart script. It detects your platform and installs dependencies with apt or Homebrew accordingly. Follow these three steps to get started:

> **NOTE:** You can follow along on other distros by using the [Distrobox Guide](./docs/DISTROBOX.md) to set up a Debian container.

> **NOTE:** On macOS the compiler runs through Rosetta 2, which Apple Silicon Macs do not install by default. If you don't have it, run `softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license`.

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theonlyzac/sly1
cd sly1
```

### 2. Run quickstart

Run the `quickstart.sh` script in the `scripts` directory. It may ask for your password to install dependencies.

You have two options to automatically extract your original game executable:

- <b>Method 1:</b> Copy the NTSC-U Sly 1 game ISO to the `disc` directory and then run:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/quickstart.sh
  ```

- <b>Method 2:</b> Specify a path to the ISO:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/quickstart.sh /path/to/GameBackup.iso
  ```

Otherwise, just copy the `SCUS_971.98` file from your game disc to the `disc` directory manually.

### 3. Build the project

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

If the build succeeds, you will see this:

```
out/SCUS_971.98: OK
```

If you have any issues, or you prefer to set up the project manually, follow the instructions below. Instructions to run the game are also provided below.

## ⚙️ Manual Setup

The project can be built on Linux, macOS, or Windows using WSL. Follow the instructions below to set up the build environment.

> **Note:** These instructions assume a Debian-based system such as Ubuntu. For other distributions, adapt the package manager commands and package names accordingly. macOS equivalents are given alongside each step.

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repo to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheOnlyZac/sly1
cd sly1
```

### 2. Extract your game's ELF file

To build the project, you will need to extract the original ELF file from your own legally obtained copy of the game. Mount the disc on your PC and copy the file `SCUS_971.98` from your disc to the `disc` directory of this project.

### 3. Setup Python environment

Install Python 3.9 or higher, pip and venv:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
```

On macOS, Python 3 is available through Homebrew:

```bash
brew install python3
```

Create a Python environment for the project:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

Then install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Setup build environment

Install 32 bit MIPS assembler and Wine:

```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt update
sudo apt install binutils-mips-linux-gnu wine32
```

> **Note:** For a lighter and faster alternative to Wine, download [`wibo-i686`](https://github.com/decompals/wibo/releases/) to the `tools` directory.

Install Ninja build system:

```bash
sudo apt install ninja-build
```

On macOS, install the assembler and Ninja with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ninja mips-linux-gnu-binutils
```

Wine is not used on macOS. Download [`wibo-macos`](https://github.com/decompals/wibo/releases/) to the `tools` directory instead, and make it executable:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o tools/wibo-macos https://github.com/decompals/wibo/releases/download/1.0.0/wibo-macos
chmod +x tools/wibo-macos
```

Setup the compiler using the provided script:

```bash
./scripts/setup_prodg.sh
```

### 5. Configure and build the project

Run the configure script and the build with ninja:

```bash
python3 configure.py
ninja
```

The default behavior is to split the binary using Splat, build the object files (inserting the split assembly in place of non-matching functions), link the matching executable, and confirm that the checksum of the built executable matches the original.

You can alter the behavior by passing any of the following arguments to  `configure.py`:

* `--clean` - Delete any existing build files and configure the project.
* `--clean-only` - Delete any existing build files **without** configuring the project.
* `--skip-checksum` - Skip the checksum verification step. This is necessary if you are intentionally changing the code, but note that the elf may not boot.
* `--objects` - Builds the object files for matching with objdiff and generates an objdiff config file. Outputs two sets of object files: `obj/target` and `obj/current` (the latter of which will be updated automatically by objdiff as you edit the source code).

The toolchain is detected automatically per platform. You can override any part of it with these environment variables, which is useful if your tools are installed under different names:

* `CROSS` - Prefix for the MIPS binutils (default `mips-linux-gnu-`).
* `WIBO` - Command used to run the Windows compiler (defaults to `tools/wibo-i686` on Linux, `tools/wibo-macos` on macOS, falling back to Wine).
* `CPP` - Preprocessor used for the split assembly (defaults to `cpp`, or `cc -E -x assembler-with-cpp` on macOS).

## 🎮 Running the Game

Running the compiled executable requires [PCSX2 2.0](https://pcsx2.net/). You must have your own copy of the original game and the BIOS from your own PS2. They are not included in this repo and we cannot provide them for you.

Once you have those, and you have built the executable `SCUS_971.98`, you can run it using one of three methods:

### Method 1: Autorun script

The `run.sh` script in the `scripts` directory will run the last successful build in the PCSX2 emulator. It will automatically detect PCSX2 installed via package manager, a macOS `PCSX2.app` bundle, Flatpak, AppImage, or XDG Desktop entries in that order and use the first ISO found in the `disc` directory to load assets.

Optionally, you can specify what ISO file to use:

```bash
./scripts/run.sh /path/to/GameBackup.iso
```

To detect the PCSX2 AppImage, it must be placed in the `tools` directory, or be "Installed" via an AppImage manager utility.

### Method 2: Run from PCSX2 CLI

To boot the elf in PCSX2 from the command line, use the following command:

```bash
pcsx2 -elf "./out/SCUS_971.98" "/path/to/GameBackup.iso"
```

* Replace `pcsx2` with the path to your PCSX2 executable if not found automatically:
  * <b>AppImage:</b> Use the path to the `.appimage` file.
  * <b>Flatpak:</b> Grant PCSX2 access to your home directory with `flatpak override --user net.pcsx2.PCSX2 --filesystem=home` or a specific directory using `--filesystem=/path/to/files`. Then use `flatpak run net.pcsx2.PCSX2` as the executable. Relative paths to the ELF and ISO files will not work, only full system paths.
  * <b>Windows:</b> Use the path to `pcsx2.exe`.
* The `-elf` parameter specifies the path to the `SCUS_971.98` you built from this project. Replace the example path if necessary. The emulator will use this ELF to boot the game.
* The last argument is the path to your game ISO. Replace the example path with the path to a backup of your own game disc. This is where the emulator will load assets from.

### Method 3: Run from PCSX2 GUI

1. In your PCSX2 games folder, make an alias (Linux) or symbolic link (Windows) called `SCUS_971.98.elf`, which points to the `out/SCUS_971.98` file built by this project.
    * Note: The alias/symlink must point to `out/SCUS_971.98`, not `out/SCUS_971.98.elf`.
2. The alias/symlink will be recognized as a game in PCSX2. Right click on it, then click `Properties... > Disc Path > Browse` and select the ISO of your game backup.
3. Click "Close" and boot the game as normal.

You only have to make the alias/symlink once, and it will update every time you build the project.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project files are sorted into the following directories. Many of them have their own readme with more info about what they contain.

* `include` - Header files for the game engine.
* `src` - The decompiled source code.
  * All of the code for the game engine is in `src/P2`.
  * Code for the game's scripting engine is in `src/P2/splice`.
* `config` - Config files for Splat (binary splitting tool).
* `scripts` - Utility scripts for setting up the build environment.
* `docs` - Documentation and instructions for contributing.
* `tools` - Utilities for function matching.
* `reference` - Reference files for functions and data structures.

When you build the executable, the following directories will be created.

* `asm` - Disassembled assembly code from the elf.
* `assets`- Binary data extracted from the elf.
* `obj` - Compiled object files.
* `out` - Compiled executables.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a decompilation?

When the developers created the game, they wrote source code and compiled it to assembly code that can run on the PS2. A decompilation involves reverse-engineering the assembly code to produce new, original code that compiles to the same assembly. This process leaves us with source code that is similar to and behaves the same as the source code (though not necessarily identical), which helps us understand what the programmers were thinking when they made the game.

### How do you decompile the code?

We use a tool called [Splat](https://github.com/ethteck/splat/) to split the binary into assembly files representing each individual function. We then reimplement every function and data structure by writing C++ code that compiles to the same assembly code. We do not copy any code from the original game binary into the decompilation.

### Has this ever been done before?

There are many other decompilation projects, but this was one of the first ones for the PS2. Our inspirations include as the [Super Mario 64 decomp](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64) for the N64 and the [Breath of the Wild decomp](https://github.com/zeldaret/botw) for the Wii U (the latter being more similar in scope to this project). There is also a Jak & Daxter decomp/PC port called [OpenGOAL](https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project), though that game is 98% GOAL language rather than C/C++.

### Is this a matching decomp?

Yes. This was the first PS2 decompilation project that targeted the PS2 and utilized function matching, before it was even possible to produce a byte-matching executable. We have built a matching elf since July 2024. Our ultimate goal is to match 100% of the game's functions.

### What is Splice?

Splice is the game's scripting engine; it handles things like scripted events, animated cutscenes, and guard spawning by executing scripts stored in the level files. The code for Splice is a distinct subset of the game engine code, which is why it has its own folder and progress percentage.
